# exifTool-configs
Configuration files for EXIFTool

Testing a config file for EXIFTool to add PREMIS event metadata by creating xmp-premis namespace. For the initial test, I will be only be trying to implement limited Event metadata according to the PREMIS 3.0 Schema: http://www.loc.gov/premis/v3. 

The use case would be to copy some metadata from the xmp-pdf tags to the xmp-premis tags (-tagsFromFile) as well as fill in some default values.
